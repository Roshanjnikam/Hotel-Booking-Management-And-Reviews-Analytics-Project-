# Hotel Reviews Analytics Project 
##### by Roshan Nikam

### 1. Introduction
##### This project analyses hotel reviews data stored in a PostgreSQL database with three tables:
  ######  •	Hotels (hotel details & base ratings)
  ######  •	Users (user demographics & traveller type)
  ######  •	Reviews (ratings & review text)
##### The objective was to explore, analyse, and visualize the data to gain business insights, build machine learning models, and create an interactive dashboard.
##### Tools used: Excel,SQL,Powerbi,Python.

### 2. Data Sources
##### •	Database: PostgreSQL
##### •	Tables:
###### hotels: hotel details, star rating, base scores (cleanliness, comfort, facilities, etc.), geo-location
###### users: user demographics, gender, country, traveller type, join date
###### reviews: user-hotel reviews with text & numerical ratings

### 3. Data Preparation
##### •	Excel: Performed initial cleaning (removed duplicates, checked missing values).
##### •	SQL: Wrote 20+ queries to answer business questions.
##### •	Python (Pandas):Merged hotels, users, and reviews into a single dataset.Extracted features (year, month, day name from review date).

### 4. SQL Analysis Insights:
##### Some Insights:
•	User id’s 710,1489,1042,588,1752 these are youngest users to write reviews.
•	Most users belong from United state then followed by United Kingdom, Germany.
•	In traveller type most common users belong to couple followed by family then solo, business.
•	The golden oasis hotel has 9.92 highest overall score then canal house grand, marina bay zenith
•	Tokyo city stands first in score cleanliness 
•	User ID 1758 wrote review more than five times.
•	Hotel "Tango Boutique” got most frequently reviews.
•	The Savannah House hotel received most rating by family travel type.
•	"The Gateway Royale" this hotel got good score from foreigners compared to locals.
•	City of Amsterdam Hotel Canal House Grand got rant first for overall score.
##### Like this there is so many insights.
#### Here Some SQL Queries:

### 5. Power BI Dashboard
###### A single dashboard was designed with the following visuals:
•	Hotel performance overview
•	Geographical map
•	Traveller type analysis
•	Review trends
•	Value for money comparison
•	Gender comparison
•	Top 10 hotels 
•	Users rushed by months 
•	Using aged group wise analysis 
•	Monthly comparisons

## 6. Python Analysis & Machine Learning
##### •	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) here some reports:
##### •	Histograms & boxplots for score overall.

### •	Machine Learning Models:
##### •	Clustering: KMeans clustering of hotels based on review scores → grouped hotels into performance categories.
